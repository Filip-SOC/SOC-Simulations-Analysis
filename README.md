<h1>SOC Incident Analyses</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This repository contains detailed analyses of security incidents handled in a Security Operations Center (SOC). Each entry covers an incident, including the detection, investigation, and mitigation process, along with lessons learned and recommendations for improving security posture. The goal is to gain real hands-on SOC skills by working through practical scenarios based on the Let's Defend platform.
